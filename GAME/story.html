                    Between internal conflicts in the country and budgetary tension, the United States are considering a way to cross the country in a safe and fairly short way. In 1863 the United States government authorized a transcontinental railway line connecting Omaha to Sacramento. 
                    This railway line will make life easier for many Americans because tens of thousands of people take the road, the crossing takes more than 6 months and is not without danger. You are a promising young engineer and you are hired by the big four, the main shareholders of the project. Your mission is to prove yourself, you have to lead the first 60 kilometers of the line.</p1>
                </div>
                <div class="text2">
                <p2>
                These first 60 kilometers are the most important because they allow to judge whether the project is feasible or not. If you are successful, your mission will continue through Nevada and Utah where many obstacles await. You will leave Sacramento the path is quite simple, the first kilometers are always the easiest.
                You will notice that the old engineers left their jobs. You will notice that they have left rails, these are unchangeable and not movable. Take inspiration from the work of your predecessors and above all do not take the wrong path, you have a limited number of rails to place.</p2></div>
                <div class="text3">
                <p3>
                After this first stage, the ground becomes more and more sinuous, there are many obstacles in your way, you must avoid them otherwise the train will risk derailing and waste precious time for the company.
                Our country is in what the local journalists call the gold rush, our site passes through some rivers although problematic for our mission they can turn into a real open pit gold mine. This kind of place, although idyllic, can make us lose a lot of men, in fact many people get rich from the little ones and leave the yard. We may lose several workers, make sure that the site is finished as quickly as possible.</p3></div>
                <div class="text4">
                <p4>
                We must not forget that we are in the middle of a war against the southerners, our convoy must get as close as possible to the border without going beyond it so as not to cause shootings to break out.The area is under surveillance and we are not safe from being attacked. In addition to this perpetual danger we will have to enter the Sierra Nevada, there will be more pitfalls and the path will require more thought.</p4></div>
                <div class="text5">
                <p5>
                The site is estimated at 4 years of long and arduous work. If we succeed in building the world's first transcontinental train, we will make life easier for millions of people and help conquer the West. Although this useful site will be deadly, many of our men will lose their lives between shootings, hunger and fatigue.
                So young engineer are you up to the challenge?
